<h3>Some Technical Description</h3>

<p><code>dhttpr</code> uses <code>inetd</code> to receive and respond to
requests using the standard input and output streams. This allows the
network/socket/communication heavy lifting to be done by an external
application, and greatly simplifies the operation of the software I have
to write.</p>

<p>The original couple of iterations of the software were called
directly by <code>inetd</code>, but as the feature set increased, the
amount of code loaded to serve each request grew alarmingly. The
current version runs as a daemon, with <code>inetd</code> invoking a
lightweight process to shuffle each request to the server process and
subsequent response back.</p>
