<p>The current version is 0.4-dev.</p>

<p>It's super-primitive, but it'll squirt HTML (and some other types of)

<a href="dhttpr_info.html">info</a>.</p>

<p>More functionality (maybe) coming (maybe) soon. Maybe.</p>

<p>Also, I'm just going to stick this image wherever I can (maybe I'll even
adopt it as the <code>dhttpr</code> mascot/logo/symbol/spirit animal):</p>
